## Course Description

The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source, code-first framework for building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents. In this course, instructor Fikayo Adepoju outlines the skills you need to build and test your own agents using the ADK. Fikayo covers how to define agents, equip them with various tools including custom functions and third-party integrations, and configure their underlying language models. Along the way, he also covers the essentials of managing input, output, and context within agents to enhance their functionality. Explore the concept of workflow agents—including sequential, loop, and parallel agent systems—and learn how to leverage built-in and MCP tools within the ADK. By the end of this course, you’ll be prepared to use the ADK to develop powerful agents and multiagent systems.
